# Okta Account Migrator

## Introduction

Okta Account Migrator is a helper tool to migrate accounts from one Okta instance to another. It reads batches of 
accounts from the source Okta to create them in the target Okta. The size of the batches is configurable. The results are 
- The accounts within the batch being created in the target Okta configured to trigger the Import Password Inline Hook as soon as the users attempt to log in, and
- A CSV file with the properties of the batch of migrated accounts to include in the communication campaign.

The new account at the target Okta is configured to import the password from the source Okta via the 'Import Password Inline Hook'. This requires the target Okta to have been setup with this hook via _Workflows => Inline Hooks => Add Inline Hook => Import Password_. The account status will trigger calling this hook. The hook is configured to call the Okta Account Migrator server with the credentials entered by the user. Okta Account Migrator attempts to authenticate with these credentials at the source Okta. If this succeeds, then the succesful response is sent to the target Okta, which will let the user in and store the password. If authentication at the Okta source fails, the user will not be able to enter the target Okta until authentication at the source succeeds.

After logging in to the target Okta, the user will be required to set up any other required authenticators as the account is newly created and second factors at the source Okta have not been migrated.

## Overview

The below diagram aimes to depict that credentials entered by a newly migrated user are checked against the source Okta. If authentication succeeeds, the password is stored in the target Okta, and the user is granted access. The next time the user logs in, the password will be checked against the target Okta.

## Security

This project is designed with security as primary focus. There is as little TLS termination as possible and the project itself implements end-to-end encryption. This means that:
- The user enters their credentials at the target login screen provided by Okta. Obviously, communication between the users client and the Okta server is encrypted using TLS.
- Okta receives the credentials as it always does. Instead of checking the credentials against the Okta Universal Directory, the credentials are sent to Okta Account Migrator. Okta Account Migrator contains an embedded Express webserver configured to terminate TLS. This means that surrounding infrastructure *does not* terminate TLS and will not send credentials unencrypted over the internal network. Credentials are sent from the target Okta instance to Okta Account Migrator end-to-end encrypted.
- Okta Account Migrator sets up a TLS encrypted connection to the API at the source Okta instance and verifies the credentials over this connection. Credentials are never logged and only processed in memory for as long as the verification takes.




## Open issues

_Issues_

- What about second factors?

_To Do_

- Implement code verification using Node.js SEA or code signing
- Implement actual moving of accounts via batches and creation of CSV
- Implement Helmet for web server hardening 
- Decommission accounts at the source Okta instance after succesful verification

(done)
- âœ… Implement HTTPS/TLS in Express
